### '프로그래밍의 원리' 수업에서 유용한 포인트들을 정리하여 기록하는 글입니다.

---

### Types in general

- Introdection : How to construct elements

- Elimination : How to use elements of the type

- Primitive types :

Int, Boolean, Double, String...

Intro for Int: ...,-2,-1,0,1,2
Elim for Int: +,-,*,/...


-Function types :

Int => Int, (Int => Int)=>(Int => Int)
Intro: (x:T)=>e
Elim: f(v)


---

### Tuples

- Intro :

(1, 2, 3) : (Int, Int, Int)
(1, "a") : (Int, String)

- Elim :

(1, "a", 10)._1 = 1
(1, "a", 10)._2 = "a"

> Only up to length 22

If you use tuple types, each has its own closure!

~~~
def bar : (x:Int) = x + 1
val a = (3+1, foo)
// def a = (4+1, bar) -> Nope!
~~~


---

### Structural types (a.k.a Record Types)

~~~
val foo = new { //or, Object foo
    val a = 3
    def b = a+1
    def f(x:Int) = b+x
    def f(x:String) = "hello"+x
}

foo.b
foo.f(3)
foo.f("gil")

def g(x: {val a: Int; def b: Int;
def f(x:Int): Int;
def f(x:String): String}) =
    x.f(3)

g(foo)
~~~

Structural types always have closure within it.

~~~
def bar(x: Int) = x+1

object foo {
  def g: Int => Int = bar _
}
~~~

---

### Structural Types : Scope and Type Alias

You can use `type` as `typedef` in C.

~~~
val gn = 0
object foo {
  val a = 3
  def b = a + 1
  def f(x: Int) = b + x + gn
}

foo.f(3)

type Foo = {val a: Int; def b: Int; def f(x:Int):Int}
def g(x: Foo) = {
  val gn = 10
  x.f(3)
}

g(foo)
~~~
