### Currying

Why we use currying? Let's look at the code, simplified by currying.

~~~
def sum(f: Int=>Int, a: Int, b: Int): Int = 
if (a <= b) f(a) + sum(f, a+1, b) else 0
def linear(n: Int) = n
def square(n: Int) = n * n
def cube(n: Int) = n * n * n
def sumLinear(a: Int, b: Int) = sum(linear, a, b)
def sumSquare(a: Int, b: Int) = sum(square, a, b)
def sumCubes(a: Int, b: Int) = sum(cube, a, b)
~~~

We want the following. How?

~~~
def sumLinear = sum(linear)
def sumSquare = sum(square)
def sumCubes = sum(cube)
~~~


- Solution :

~~~
def sum(f: Int => Int): (Int, Int) => Int = {
  def sumF(a: Int, b: Int): Int =
    if (a <= b) f(a) + sumF(a+1, b) else 0
  sumF
}

def sumLinear = sum(linear)
def sumSquare = sum(square)
def sumCube = sum(cube)

sumSquare(3, 10) + sumCubes(5, 20)

// We don't need to define the wrapper funcitons

sum(suquare)(3, 10) + sum(cube)(5, 20)
~~~

We can also write as follows :

~~~
def sum(f: Int => Int): (Int, Int) => Int =
  (a, b) => if (a <= b) f(a) + sum(f)(a+1, b) else 0
~~~

If compiler is not smart as we expected, above function should make anonymous function `(a, b) => sth` everytime `sum(f)` is called, so it could be slower than the function using `sumF`. (Because anonymous function doesn't have its own name, otherwise, once `sumF` is defined, it is used without need to be declared again) But if compiler optimize this code(because `sum(f)` is used recursively), it may not be executed fast.


Or more simply, and **probably the best way** :

~~~
def sum(f: Int => Int)(a: Int, b: Int): Int =
  if (a <= b) f(a) + sum(f)(a+1, b) else 0
~~~

### Currying and Uncurrying

A function of Type 

`(T1, T2, ... ,Tn) => T`

can be turned into one of type

`T1 => (T2 => (... Tn =>T)`

This is called 'currying' named after Haskell Brooks Curry. The opposite direction is called 'uncurrying'.

### Currying using Anonymous Functions

~~~
def foo(x: Int, y: Int, z: Int)(a: Int, b: Int) =
  x + y + z + a + b

val f1 = (x: Int, z: Int, b: Int) => foo(x, 1, z)(2, b)

val f2 = foo(_: Int, 1, _: Int)(2, _: Int)

val f3 = (x: Int, z: Int) => (b: Int) => foo(x, 1, z)(2, b)

f1(1, 2, 3)
f2(1, 2, 3)
f3(1, 2)(3)
~~~

### Excercise : Cutty the mapReduce function

~~~
def mapReduce(combine: (Int,Int)=>Int,inival: Int,
f: Int=>Int, a: Int, b: Int): Int = {
if (a <= b) combine(f(a),mapReduce(combine,inival,f,a+1,b))
else inival
}

def sum(f: Int=>Int, a: Int, b: Int): Int =
mapReduce((x,y)=>x+y,0,f,a,b)

def product(f: Int=>Int, a: Int, b: Int): Int =
mapReduce((x,y)=>x*y,1,f,a,b)
~~~

- Solution : 


~~~
def mapReduce2(combine: (Int, Int) => Int, inival: Int)
              (f: Int => Int) (a : Int, b: Int): Int ={
    if (a <= b) combine(f(a), mapReduce2(combine, inival)(f)(a+1, b))
    else inival
}

// need to make a closure since mapReduce is param. code. 
def sum2 = mapReduce2((x, y) => x+y, 0) _

// val is better than def. Think about why.
// If you use 'def', you need to 'close' your code everytime is is called.
val product2 = mapReduce2((x, y) => x*y, 1) _


sum2(linear)(0,100)
product2(square)(1, 5)
~~~

You need to add '_'(underbar) after `def sum2` so that it explicitly declares include methods invisible.

(Error message : missing argument list for method mapReduce2 in class. Unapplied methods are only converted to functions when a function type is expected. You can make this conversion explicit by writing `mapReduce2 _` or `mapReduce2(_,_)(_)(_,_)` instead of `mapReduce2`.)

### Exceptions

~~~
class factRangeException(val arg: Int) extends Exception

def fact(n: Int): Int =
    if (n < 0) throw new factRangeException(n)
    else if (n == 0) 1
    else n * fact(n -1)

def foo(n : Int) = fact(n + 10)

try {
    println(fact(3))
    println(foo(-100))
} catch {
    case e : factRangeException => {
        println("fact range error: " + e.arg)
    }
}
