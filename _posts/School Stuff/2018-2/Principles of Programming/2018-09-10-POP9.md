### Sub Type Polymorphism (Concept)

Let's assume that we want this: 

~~~
object tom {
	val name = "Tom"
	val home = "02-880-1234"
}

object bob {
	val name = "Bob"
	val home = "02-123-1234"
}

def greeting(r: ???) = "Hi " + r.name + ", How are you?"

greeting(tom)
greeting(bob)

// Note that we have

tom: {val name: String; val home: String}
bob: {val name: String; val mobile: String}
~~~

What about we use sub types?

~~~
type NameHome = {val name: String; val home: String}
type NameMobile = {val name: String; val mobile: String}
type Name = {val name: String}

NameHome <: Name 	// (NameHome is a sub type of Name)
NameMobile <: Name  // (NameMobile is a sub type of Name)

def greeting(r: Name) = "Hi " + r.name + ", How are you?"

greeting(tom)
greeting(bob)
~~~

The sub type relation is kind of the subset relation, **but they are NOT the same.**

- `T <: S`

Every element of `T` can be used as that of `S`.

- *Cf*. `T` is a subset of `S`.

Every element of `T` **is** that of `S`.

- Why polymorphism?

A function of type `S=>R` can be used as `T=>R` for many sub types `T` of `S`.

Note that `S=>R <:T=>R` when `T<:S`.

### Two Kinds of Sub Types

- Structural Sub Types

The system implicitly determines the sub type relation by the 
structures of data types.

Structurally equivalent types are the same.

- Nominal Sub Types

The user explicitly specify the sub type relation using the names of 
data types.

Structurally equivalent types with different names may be different.

### Structural Sub Types

- **General Sub type**

Reflexivity:

For any type T, we have:
	`T <: T`

Transivity:

For any types `T`,`S`,`R`, we have:
	`T <: R			R <: S`
	`====================`
		  `T <: S`

---

### Sub Types for Special Types

- Nothing : The empty set

- Any : The set of all values

- For any type `T`, we have:

	`Nothing <: T <: Any`

- Example:

~~~
val a: Int = 3
val b: Any = a
def f(a: Nothing): Int = a
// def g(a: Any): Int = a 	=> There is no elimination form!
~~~

`Nothing` makes impossible possible. It can make anything!

`Any` can be any type, but does not give any useful information! So, It is just garbage! You can't do `any`thing! (Pardon the pun)

### Sub Types for Records

- Permutation

			=======================
`{…; x: T1; y: T2; …} <: {…;  y: T2, x: T1; … }`


- Width

			=======================
			{…; x: T; …} <: { …; … }

- Depth

					T <: S
			=======================
		{…;  x: T ; …} <: { …; x: S; … }

- Example
~~~
{val x: { val y: Int; val z: String}, val w: Int}
<:             // (by permutation)
{val w: Int; val x: { val y: Int; val z: String}}
<:             // (by depth & width)
{val w: Int; val x: {val z: String}}
~~~


> Sub type trasnformation acts as if 'type casting', but doesn't involve any computation!

---

### Sub Types for Functions

- Function Sub Type

~~~
			T <: T’      S <: S’ 
		  =======================
			 (T’=>S) <: (T=>S’)
~~~


- Tuple sub type

~~~
			T1 <: S1		T2 <: S2
			========================
        	  (T1, T2) <: (S1, S2)
~~~

- Example

~~~
def foo(s: {val a: Int; val b: Int}):
	{val x: Int; val y: Int} = {
		object tmp {
			val x = s.b
			val y = s.a
		}
		tmp
	}

val gee:
	{val a: Int; val b: Int; val c: Int} =>
	{val x: Int} =
	foo _
~~~



- Exercise 1

If `(T1=>T2)=>T3 <: (T1'=>T2')=>T3'` holds, clarify all the relation between them.


- Solution 1

Use sub type rules.

~~~
Since (T1'=>T2') <: (T1=>T2), we can interpret them into...
T1 <: T1', T2' <: T2
Similary, we can conclude that T3 <: T3'
~~~


- Exercise 2

If `T1=>(T2=>T3) <: T1'=>(T2'=>T3')` holds, clarify all the relation between them.


- Solution 2

~~~
Since (T2=>T3) <: (T2'=>T3'), we can interpret them into...
T2' <: T2, T3 <: T3'
Similary, we can conclude that T1' <: T1
~~~
